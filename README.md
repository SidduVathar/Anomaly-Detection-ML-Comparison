# Anomaly Detection Using Various ML Models

A hands-on demo repository to **understand how the same anomaly detection strategy performs using different Machine Learning approaches** across time-series data. This project showcases implementations and comparisons of multiple ML models for anomaly detection, helping you observe strengths and limitations of each.

## 📌 Overview

Anomaly detection (also known as outlier detection) refers to identifying rare items or events that deviate significantly from expected behavior. It’s widely used in domains like cybersecurity, finance, predictive maintenance, and time-series monitoring.

This repository includes:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with time-series anomaly detection experiments (`Time_Series ML Model.ipynb`)
- Code to apply and compare various ML models for finding anomalies

## 🚀 Features

✔ Compare different machine learning models for anomaly detection  
✔ Apply methods on real or synthetic time-series datasets  
✔ Visualize performance and anomaly results  

> ⭐ This project is ideal for learners and developers looking to deepen their understanding of anomaly detection with practical ML implementations.
